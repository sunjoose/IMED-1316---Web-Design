<h1>Website Project</h1>
</div>
<p align="left">The Website Project is the culmination of all that you have learned in this course. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Students in the traditional class will present their websites to the class.</li>
<li>Students in the online class will make a Tegrity Recording demonstrating the pages of their site and addressing the questions on the Summary page. For examples of websites and the video presentation, see these Youtube videos.</li>
<li>In this one, I walk you through how I grade it. Double-check this semester's assignment to see if any elements have changed due to updates in technologies and browsers: &nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/7nKFlw_3Ilo?list=PL88F3BEEYlT2ZyVzTRRAmbNQ-dDHNf4US" target="_blank">League of Legends</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>These are other student projects that got A's, so you don't feel so intimidated by the League of Legends assignment.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hBgkqjiMo8s?list=PL88F3BEEYlT2ZyVzTRRAmbNQ-dDHNf4US" target="_blank">Restaurant </a>| <a href="https://youtu.be/eVabrHcns8Y?list=PL88F3BEEYlT2ZyVzTRRAmbNQ-dDHNf4US" target="_blank">Colombia is Passion</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/XRYONuEnSqg?list=PL88F3BEEYlT2ZyVzTRRAmbNQ-dDHNf4US" target="_blank">Ice Cream</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Student Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify how the Internet functions with specific attention to the World Wide Web and file transfer.</li>
<li>Apply design techniques in the creation and optimization of graphics and other embedded elements.</li>
<li>Demonstrate the use of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) formatting and layout standards.</li>
<li>Design, create, test, and maintain a web site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Layout</h2>
<p align="left"><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: Plan the layout of the elements on your pages.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>SCORING:</strong> The design layout is a ten-point assignment. Instructor will guide student with suggestions; student may change it as much as they wish.</p>
<p align="left"><strong></strong><b>REFERENCE</b>: To see two very different examples of what a design layout can look like, see Figure 3-3 on page 142 and Figure 4-2 on page 225.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>THEME:</strong> You should have a unifying theme for your website.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>DESCRIPTION:&nbsp;</b>The design layout (also called a wireframe or story board) should show each page of your five-page website. Submit Word, Adobe Illustrator, Power Point, or a scanned dark sharpie sketch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some elements need to be&nbsp;<b>identical</b>&nbsp;on every page. These are the&nbsp;<b>BANNER</b>,&nbsp;<b>NAVIGATION BAR</b>, and&nbsp;<b>FOOTER</b>.</li>
<li>Consider a subtopic for each page, and label the page with that.</li>
<li>One page is the Index. One page is the Summary. &nbsp;The other pages may be whatever you wish.</li>
<li><strong>At a minimum,</strong> on each page, mark the layout of the header, banner, nav bar,&nbsp;sections, asides, footers, youtube video link, audio, linked image, logo, .MP3, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">SUBMIT this to the Project Brainstorming Discussion Forum for peer review and ideas. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Summary Page - <em>25% of your project grade</em></span></h2>
<p align="left"><b>OBJECTIVES</b>: &nbsp;(1) Avoid plagiarism by giving credit for elements used in your web site that are not your own.&nbsp; (2) Type a description, analysis, and problems experienced&nbsp;in the process you went through in developing your website.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>DESCRIPTION:&nbsp;</b>The Summary page is the final page of your five-page website. It has the same elements as every page (Banner, Navigation Bar, and Footer.) Other than that, it does not contain graphics unless you wish you use graphic images such as you see in this document.&nbsp; That is not necessary; it will not improve your grade.</p>
<p align="left">Now that you have chosen your topic, create a blank HTM file. Name this page summary.htm.&nbsp; Do not worry about the formatting for now; just include the links you use. When you finish the rest of your website, you can copy the common elements and CSS style link into this document, and it should flow nicely with your website.</p>
<p align="left">Make two sections or headings on the page. Label them&nbsp;<b>Analysis</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Links</b>. For the first section (labeled&nbsp;<b>ANALYSIS</b>), copy and paste the following questions AS TEXT into the page.</p>
<ol>
<li>How did you change copied or borrowed material to make it more original?</li>
<li>What difficulties did you encounter in building the website? How did you overcome them?</li>
<li>What part of the website are you most proud of? Why?</li>
<li>If you had more time, what would you change?</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Answer these questions as you work through the project.&nbsp; Post your answers to the summary page.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">For the second section (labeled&nbsp;<b>LINKS</b>), post the links to anything you used in the creation of this project, including online tutorials, images, style sheets, banner generators, thumbnail generators, javascript libraries, etc. Make sure the links are attractive - not underlined, with a CSS style for the hover or rollover effect.</p>
<p align="left"><em><b>You must give credit for your sources. Every link, product, software, or site mentioned that you did not create from scratch must be linked. GOOGLE IS NOT A SOURCE. GOOGLE IS A SEARCH ENGINE THAT LEADS YOU TO THE SOURCE.</b></em></p>
<h2>Website Elements</h2>
<p align="left">The structural elements of your website must include a banner with a logo, a navigation bar, an aside, sections, articles, and a footer.&nbsp; The banner, footer, and nav bar&nbsp;should be consistent across all pages of the site, even the summary page.</p>
