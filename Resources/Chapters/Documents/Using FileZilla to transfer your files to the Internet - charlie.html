<h1><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Using FileZilla to transfer your files to the Internet</span></h1>
<p>If you are not using the Chrome browser, close the browser and open Chrome. You must use Chrome in this class. Don't have it? Download and install Google Chrome, which is linked in the Resources folder in eCampus.</p>
<p><a href="#chrome"><em>Why do I have to use Google Chrome?</em></a></p>
<p>Move this page to one side of your screen while you follow these instructions. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/BdFlxNHPafk" target="new">(How do I see multiple windows at the same time?)</a></em></p>
<h2>Prepare your work space.</h2>
<h3>Download Filezilla.</h3>
<p>Using the Chrome browser<em> </em>on your computer, download FileZilla Portable, which is linked in the Resources folder in eCampus.</p>
<p>You will get a popup confirming where to save the executable application. Navigate to your flash drive and select your IMED1316 folder. Save the compressed file there. Expand/unzip the file by double-clicking it.<em> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files" target="new">(Help! This isn't working.)</a></em></p>
<p>Now you have the FileZilla app you need to upload your work to the Internet.</p>
<h3>Set up FileZilla.</h3>
<p>First, you must have a username and password. I have already emailed that to you here in eCampus. (How to check eCampus email.)</p>
<p>For the purpose of these instructions, let's PRETEND your directory is "Alpha" and your username is "a19". Everyone's password is IMed1316 (case sensitive).</p>
<p>Use FileZilla to transfer files to the Internet</p>
<ol>
<li>Open FileZilla by clicking FileZilla.<strong>exe</strong> in your IMED1316 folder (not FileZilla.<strong>zip</strong>) <em><em>(Can't see the .zip or .exe extensions? <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=show%20file%20extensions%20windows" target="new">Click here and select which version of Windows you're using.)</a></em></em></li>
<li>Host: ftp://web.blinn.edu/alpha</li>
<li>Username: a19</li>
<li>Password: IMed1316 (case sensitive, no space)</li>
<li>Click <strong>Quickconnect</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Submit your assignment to the D2L Drop Box using Filezilla.</span></h1>
<h3>4. Upload your folder containing your completed assignment using FileZilla.</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the lower right hand box, click <b>a19</b>. <em>(Actually, you'll click your OWN username.)</em></li>
<li>In the lower left hand box, find the folder you wish to upload.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Drag that folder from the left hand box to the right hand box.<br /> <img src="../Images/Select%20your%20folder%20for%20transfer%20to%20FTP.png" alt="Select your folder for transfer to FTP" title="Select your folder for transfer to FTP" width="372" height="227" /></li>
<li>In the right-hand box, right click on that folder name.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Copy URL to clipboard.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Open the link in Chrome.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Paste the link into a new tab in Chrome. Hit ENTER.</li>
<li>Replace the&nbsp;first three letters (<strong>FTP</strong>) with <strong>HTTP</strong>. Hit ENTER again. You should see something like this:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../Images/View%20of%20URL%20after%20copying%20it%20to%20clipboard%2C%20pasting%20in%20Chrome%2C%20and%20replacing%20FTP%20with%20HTTP.png" alt="View of URL after copying it to clipboard, pasting in Chrome, and replacing FTP with HTTP" title="View of URL after copying it to clipboard, pasting in Chrome, and replacing FTP with HTTP" width="339" height="348" /></p>
<h3>6. Paste the link into the eCampus drop box.</h3>
<ol>
<li>In eCampus, in the Drop Box for the assignment, upload a generic .TXT file. Please do not be clever and upload a music, video, or image file. They take up too much server space. <a href="#txt"><em>(How to create a generic.txt file to use for all eCampus submissions.)</em></a></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Comments</strong> box.</li>
<li>Paste the URL into the D2L comment box.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Place your cursor after HTML and hit ENTER.</li>
<li>NOW it should be underlined.</li>
<li>Try the link and see if it takes you to the right place.&nbsp; Look it over to make sure it looks good enough for a grade.</li>
<li>If so, you are ready to successfully submit your work for grading.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="flashdrive">Why you need a flash drive even if you have a laptop</h3>
<p>If you need help with your assignment and come to me for assistance, you will need all of your work on that flash drive. You and I will pop it into my computer to view the trouble.</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Why you have to use the Chrome browser</h3>
<p>There are many variables among computers, including platforms (Windows/Mac/Android) and browsers (Chrome/Edge/IE/Safari/Firefox). When students have problems and ask me for help, I can eliminate this variable from our troubleshooting.</p>
