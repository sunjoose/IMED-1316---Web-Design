<p>In this assignment, you will gather the materials you need to do the assignments. Also, see the video&nbsp;</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/XhdIZL6dj6w" target="_blank">How to do your assignments - from start to finish</a></p>
<h3>Download and extract the Data Files</h3>
<p>All assignments begin with data files that match the assignments in the textbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Insert your flash drive into your laptop. (See "Materials" in the Syllabus.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create a folder on your flash drive. Name it IMED1316 (no spaces).</p>
<p>3. Create a&nbsp;subfolder in IMED1316 called DATAFILES (no spaces)</p>
<p>4. Download the data files from eCampus by clicking here: <a href="Documents/DataFiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Files</a>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you get a&nbsp;popup asking where to save them, select the IMED1316 folder on your flash drive.</li>
<li>If you do not get a popup asking where to save them, they probably went to your "Downloads" folder. Move them to the IMED1316 folder on your flash drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Extract the data files. The data files are compressed, so you will need to extract the files. Open File Explorer and find the zipped folder. Right-click (or press and hold) it, select&nbsp;Extract All, and follow the instructions, making sure to select IMED1316 &gt; DATAFILES.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Download and set up&nbsp;your text editor</h3>
<p>Assignments are done using a text editor that you probably do not have.&nbsp;Windows computers come with Notepad or Wordpad, but Notepad++ is what we will use so that I can explain every step to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. For Windows, click this link: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Notepad%2B%2B%20Portable/NotepadPlusPlusPortable_7.5.paf.exe/download?use_mirror=iweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a>. Save it to your IMED1316 folder. If that link doesn't work, try this one:&nbsp;<a href="https://portableapps.com/">https://portableapps.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double click on it and install it to IMED1316.</p>
<p>2. For Mac, click this link: <a href="https://atom.en.softonic.com/?ex=DSK-347.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atom</a>. Drag it to your taskbar.</p>
